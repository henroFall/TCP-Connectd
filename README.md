# TCP-Connectd - (mod2019)
SmartThings - TCP connected in local integration


This App allow Smartthings to control TCP bulbs in local network

You must have a TCP Gateway with version 2, sice Smartthings does not allow to send local commands to a asuto sign certificate

Its recommended your gateway have an stattic Ip address to avoid update the ip address in the connect app.


I have made a slight modification to this code to fix an issue with setting any bulb to a % brightness. If only on/off work, try this code instead.
